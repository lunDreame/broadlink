Home Assistant integration for Broadlink devices

## Setup

**Reference** 
This user integration component is based on the official core integration (broadlink) and adds a supporting device (Ledvance [0x6498, 0xA7B6]).
Therefore, we state that we are not responsible for any problems that arise during use.
